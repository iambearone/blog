You are not always the same you. I am not always the same me.

We fluctuate through states, with peaks and valleys across multiple parameters.

It’s your responsibility, when you hit a peak, to sprint. To develop habits and routines that support you through a valley. To make change while you’re at the top. And then slowly, but more and more often, you’ll find that you’ve sprinted so fast that you’re launching across the next valley in a paraglider instead of tumbling down the mountain.
