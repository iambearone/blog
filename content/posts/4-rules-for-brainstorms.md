1. Diverge before you converge – the trick to getting more good ideas is to just get more ideas on the board.
2. Go lateral – you can’t dig a new hole by digging the same hole twice.
3. Illegal, immoral, grounds for firing. It’s easier to make an innovative/impactful idea feasible than it is to make a feasible idea innovative/impactful.
4. Use tools and processes. It’ll feel forced the first few times. Design thinking, or any other innovation/ideation process. It’ll work, if you do the work – even when it feels weird.
