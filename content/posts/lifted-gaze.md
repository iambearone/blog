Grinding it out is important. Totally dominating the to-do list. Inbox 0. Getting things done.

Daily elevation is equally vital. Getting into the helicopter, and getting the 5000 foot perspective on things. Making sure that projects are prioritised correctly. Evaluating impact on overall business metrics.

I always forget how important it is to go further than that. Get right into outer space, for a 10 mile high perspective.

Are we in the business we think we’re in? Who is our next generation of customers? Why do we work the way we do?

Getting the elevation is hard as long as the everyday is dominant. Getting into outer space gets easier when completely removing oneself from regular business. Possibly the most underrated benefit of going to conferences and/or taking holidays.

Getting out of the office can be a great first step to getting out of your head – and that’s key.

Gotta get out of the machine to be able to work on it.
