99% of the time, you’re asking the wrong question. Re-frame your question. Re-evaluate the basis for asking it. If you ask the wrong questions, it doesn’t matter how good you are at finding the answers. They won’t matter. 


Just like in The Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy – there’s the answer - 42, so what?

This applies whether you’re trying to develop your business, going hiking, learning handstands, writing a book, or anything else. Take a moment to evaluate the questions you’re trying to answer. A good filter is this: Imagine you have the answer. OK. So what?
