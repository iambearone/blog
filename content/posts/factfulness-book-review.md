_Ten reasons we’re wrong about the world, and why things are better than you think._

The crowning jewel of one man’s life work. One of the most important books Bill Gates has ever read. Hans Rosling’s Factfulness is a bit of a masterpiece.

The team behind Factfulness is the same team that’s developed https://www.gapminder.org/

There are ten instincts that guide us astray when it comes to interpreting how the world is really developing.
***
1. Gap – look for the majority  
There is much talk of “growing inequality” – but what about the middle? Is there really a gap, or is there a large middle? (hint: there’s almost never a gap)

2. Negativity – expect bad news  
Bad things happen. The world is not finished with getting better. The media tends to pick out stories that make for good headlines – that means bad news.

3. Straight line – lines might bend (see Trend Forecasting Is Weird)  
We default to an assumption of a steady rate of change. Depending on what’s causing the change, that might not be the case at all. Most lines bend at some point, often as a logistic curve.

4. Fear – calculate the risks  
Some things are extremely scary. Terrorism, war, disease. When thinking about them, think about what the risk is.

5. Size – get things in proportion  
Case in point: nobody really knows how the population of the world is distributed (to the closest billion)  
Developing markets account for a huge part of the worlds population, with billions of people coming online in Asia, and billions more following in Africa soon.

6. Generalisation – question your categories  
Stereotypes are super helpful for making sense of things. But a regular examination of the categories used for stereotyping is key. If a category doesn’t exist anymore, or new categories have come into existence, we have to update our map (The Map is not The Territory)

7. Destiny – slow change is still change  
Nothing is destined. We can change it. And when the change is slow, even one person at a time, it’s still change. https://www.charitywater.org/ is an excellent example of something that could seem discouraging, but really isn’t. Paying a monthly fee gets drinking water to X people for at least a year. Small change, but still change.
Also, get perspective by talking to grandpa, because it’s almost certain that the world was very different (even where you live) when he was a kid.

8. Single – get a tool box  
NEVER just examine something from one perspective. “What does it look like for person X”?

9. Blame – resist pointing your finger  
It’s probably not someone’s fault. It’s probably something we have to work on as a team.

10. Urgency – take small steps  
It’s not either-or. It’s not radical change or no change. Just change something. Ever so slowly, things get better.

These 10 rules of thumb are what Hans & team put forth as the top 10 things to address. I buy it.
