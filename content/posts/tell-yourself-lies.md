A meditation on the power of bias and story.

I lie frequently and with great energy. I lie with reckless abandon. I lie until the lie I told is true. 

I lied about being an avid reader until I started reading every day. I lied about being brave enough to speak on stage, until I was looking out at a crowd, alive. I lied about being a structured professional, until I became a team leader. I lied about the motivation for my work, until it became driven by the same purpose. I lied about love, until it was true. I lied about being an athlete, and it took me to the top of the class. 

My lies are frequent, pervasive, powerful, and life changing. I lie to myself, and I lie to others. 

I lie to start a better story. I lie to make things worth doing. I lie to make change. 

A lie is an opportunity. It is something untrue, but in evoking it, I set into motion that which can make it true. 

If I tell myself I am an avid reader, why wouldn’t I pick up a book when I’m bored? What does it matter that the lie preceded what became an eventual truth?

If I lie about being structured at work, I must follow through on the lie, and make it true. 

A lie unlocks a thousand pathways, and enables a choice. A lie is something you can choose to live until it’s true. A lie is a cocoon to spin a beautiful emergence from.

Lie with me.
