I will routinely perform 10x better in a situation if I’ve spent roughly 1-2x the duration of the situation on preparing for the situation.

That mean’s for a 30 minute meeting, with 30-60 minutes of prep, that meeting will see me deliver 10x better results than if I was winging it.

Nothing else delivers that kind of ROI. No stimulant or nootropic comes close. The caveat is – of course – that the bill is paid with the only completely non-renewable resource available to me; time.

The ROI just seems so **STEEP** though. Prep is literally a superpower with supremely high returns on the time invested.
