You know that feeling, when after a long, hard day at work, a mind-numbing commute home, and what seems to be a mini-battle with the lock on the front door, you get to collapse on the sofa and just belong.

You know that feeling of waking up late on a Saturday, sunlight creeping through the room, and there’s nothing to do for hours, so you can just look at that light creeping along. Slow. Relaxed. In touch.

You know that feeling when you look at someone during conversation, and you kinda have to stop listening for a second to just appreciate the pure connection you have. Belonging. Trust. Love.

And have you ever felt that way with a brand? I have.

If I hadn’t felt it myself, I wouldn’t have believed it was possible. Now that I know it is, I’ll have a hard time settling for less. I think it’s a fantastic benchmark to set for the business. 

If I make this, and a customer uses it, will it feel like home? Safe, familiar, slow, relaxed, in touch, belonging, trust, or love? And if not, how can I change it until I think they will? 

That’s the level of service customers deserve. That’s the story I want to tell.

If you can do that – really make someone feel like they’re coming home – you’re creating something priceless, generous, authentic.

Something worth sharing.
