There’s not much difference between saying hi to 100% of your team when you get to work, and saying hi to 80% of your team. But the small difference from 80 – 100% is a huge difference. To someone it can be the difference between caring and indifference. Showing up vs. not showing up.

Humanity changes radically with small adjustments.

What’s the difference between greeting someone with a firm handshake or a hug?

Showing up on time every time VS 90% of the time.

Sending emails to employees after hours VS queueing them for the morning.

Leaving the office at 5pm every day VS leaving when you finish whatever you were doing between 4-6pm.

High fives VS fist bumps.

Smiles VS Laughs

Emojis VS Punctuation

Tiny things change everything, all day, every day.
