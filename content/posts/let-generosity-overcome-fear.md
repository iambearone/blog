Giving is scary. A creeping fear lingers, always, that what you’ve got is not enough. That your gift will not be well received.

The fear persists across so many domains. Contributing to group projects, starting a business, giving presents, personal relationships, community participation, leadership.

Fear gets in the way of generosity.

The desire to contribute is in constant combat with the reptilian thought that your contribution will be deemed unworthy.

Any time we make progress it’s because the desire to contribute wins out, breaks free, and leaves a mark.

Let generosity overcome fear!

## Genuinely Generous
I have a benchmark perception that I lean on to let me know when I’m being genuinely generous. It’s when I feel like it might be a little over the top.

When I feel like I might be doing too much, or going too far.

Being decent, insofar as making a real difference goes, typically comes from going unexpectedly far. The distinctiveness of the approach makes it even more likely that whatever gesture I’m making hits home and makes a lasting difference.

And when generosity wins, why not have it win by a large margin?

Let generosity overcome fear.
