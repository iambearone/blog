Your brain doesn’t output a higher wattage than anybody else’s. Neither does mine.

Solving hard problems doesn’t come from intensity. You don’t “think harder” at it.

Problems are solved during the approach phase. Like Luke Skywalker dropping bombs in the exhaust vents instead of hammering the deflector shields.

We talk about problems as if they need to be cracked. But that sensation of cracking is analogous not to brute force, but to the feeling of a strong resistance followed by complete surrender. In problem solving that happens when the approach vector is changed.

Reframing, invalidating, inverting, and other ways of seeing problems in a new light.

You’re not 10x smarter than anyone. But you can pretty easily turn up from the other direction.
