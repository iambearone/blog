Another lil’ sneaky by Simon Sinek.

This book has value, but I was not ready to extract that value on my first pass-through. I will have to revisit the book at a more opportune time in my life to get the full juice out of it.

The idea is simple, and I embrace it – we cannot win at life. We play the game to perpetuate the game.

It’s a book that invites an existential crisis in many ways. The whole idea of there being no point, no finish line, no clear rules. Oh, and not knowing when the game will end. Yea, total breakdown material.

When you can win a game, it makes sense to try. When you can’t win, spend more time trying to play well than trying to win.
