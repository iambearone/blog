If customers are loyal, it’s for mechanical reasons – contractual lock-in, unique features, extreme switching costs.

Customers don’t care about brands – they care about their family and friends, maybe their career, and sometimes where the next meal is going to come from – not brands.

Build a market share so extreme there’s nowhere else to go, and you’ve got loyalty on lock.
