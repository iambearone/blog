We have so little time. Often, I am struck by the insignificance of all that I am, and all that I have done. Struck by a desire to be more, do more, change more. A desire that all too often is unfulfilled.

Is it fuelled by ego? If so it should be quelled.

Is it a legitimate desire to change the world for the better? Perhaps "being more" is a means to an end - by being more, I can do more, and therein lies the meaning.

Is it for money and glory? If being more is merely an end to status and money, oh how worthless a goal.

Is it for the freedom to create? Then it is a fire to be let loose.

I am confounded by the motivations behind the desire, andÂ how to let it out, and how much to expect from it. Perhaps gratitude is more fortuitous than desire to create a legacy.
