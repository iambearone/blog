Life is made up of a long series of fragmented experiences. Every day is a chance to write something new into memory. But most of life, for most people, passes and is forgotten in a blur of meaninglessness.

I’m working hard to change my path through life, and create more moments worth remembering. It doesn’t have to be hard. For me, two things work well.

* Noticing. The simple act of taking time to take in the experience of the everyday. By really noticing the smile, the way the light falls, or how something feels, it’s like I flip on a switch and see how all of the human experience is in fact worth remembering. 
* Doing it differently. By breaking routine, and doing something remarkably different, I can create moments that are memorable to myself and others. It makes me feel alive, it builds a catalogue of vivid memories, and it spreads the vibe to others. What’s not to like?

The frame is simple, the execution is hard. My challenge is consistency. It’s too easy to fall back into rote.

Fight back, make it worth remembering.
