The way I see the world is fundamentally different from every other person out there. This is because I’ve got a different bunch of DNA combined with a different set of actual experiences, and it’s shaped the lens through which I view everything.

My map does most things well. However, it doesn’t look like your map. You map probably also does most things well.

My map isn’t more correct than yours, because it’s a stretch to label all but a tiny part of existence as “objective”.

However, our maps are different from each other, from the underlying data, and from everyone else’s map. They’re also being updated all the time.

Actually, they’re pretty terrible, as far as maps go, and it’s surprising that we’ve gotten this far!
