I spend time with people like me. I am one of those people who has enough.

When I want to help people, whether to pay it forward or for any other reason, I help people who I spend time with, who are like me. People who have enough.

I never help those who do not have enough.

This pattern is hard to break, but must be broken. If I only hold a light for those who have light, why bother?

I would be one who holds a light for someone who doesnâ€™t have a light. The first step to reconciling this want is the reflection that there is a tension.

I invite you to join me in observing the tension, and considering the next step. How can we hold a light for those who have none?
