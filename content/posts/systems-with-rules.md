Knowing the rules of the game seems like an indisputable prerequisite for winning. We’re used to systems with rules. The rules govern behaviour and limit potential outcomes to a manageable level.

Systems with rules are easy. Systems with known rules are extremely easy.

Most of life has no rules, and of the parts that do, most of the rules are unknown.

* Finding a rule that most people don’t know is a huge competitive advantage, and there’s a presumably infinite space to explore to find the rules.
* The drive to spend time in systems with rules is understandable. The big system with almost no rules is terrifying.
