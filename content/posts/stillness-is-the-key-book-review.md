Ryan Holiday condenses the wisdom of stoics into a short manual for living. Again.

Previous work by Ryan Holiday (such as Ego Is The Enemy) is themed around specific concepts, which provide some continuity during the reading experience. This latest addition to the collection follows a different hierarchy.

The core idea is that stillness is a missing ingredient in many people’s lives today. This core is examined through 3 lenses – mind, soul and body. These could also be described as thinking, feeling and doing.

So the book is about thinking, feeling and doing things to achieve this ideal of stillness.

Holiday draws on multiple historical and modern examples to underscore each of the points made about specific methods within each domain, which is part of what lends this read some weight.

Many of the chapters within each section deal with things I’ve come to see as basic truths for life, which means that the book is most useful as a reminder. A use case might be reviewing and meditating on one chapter per week for 6 months.

It’s strange how even the most basic truths can be forgotten in the rush to compete, to be someone, to make a difference – and so a book like this certainly has a value and a place as exactly this sort of reminder. A gentle push in the right direction, when reviewed periodically.

Some of the truths include being present, limiting the input stream, letting go of ego, deciding what “enough” looks like, practicing gratitude, saying no, building a routine and acting with virtue and courage. Generally principles that are hard to disagree with, but also things that are hard to stay sharp on at all times.

On the cover is a quote from Angela Duckworth: “A must read in our noisy world”. I agree. The book has its place because there is too much noise, and it’s too easy to forget these things in the daily rush. I’d venture to add to that quote:

Reading this book once gets the idea in place. But reading it multiple times, revisiting specific sections, and staying in tune with each of the basic truths in it – that’s how to find and maintain the stillness that is so key.
