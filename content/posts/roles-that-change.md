For a huge variety of reasons, it can be absolutely necessary for the relationship between two people to change or rebalance.

Maybe someone got a promotion, a family was extended or reduced, someone learned a new skill, or a multitude of other things.

The relationship that was, is no more – but the behaviours that supported the old relationship linger. The perception of status roles are strongly ingrained.

Most primates fix a good portion of this by beating each other senseless, and/or murder. Humans don’t, which means we get to deal with it in novel ways. Deal with it, or deal with a backlash down the road, when the new relationship has been damaged sufficiently by old behaviours.

What relationship has changed under your feet without you updating your perception or behaviours accordingly?
