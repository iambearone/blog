>Feelings are much like waves, we can’t stop them from coming but we can choose which one to surf.  
*Jonatan Mårtensson*

Every day is another chance to look anew into life and be moved. Ride the highs and dodge the lows. But most important – be moved. 

When you look into another’s eyes, feel the cold wind bite, feel alive in the world; what an experience to have – what a chance to feel. 

When you succeed. When you make something for someone. When you change the world – what a wave to ride.
