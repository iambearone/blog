Meditation in its “pure” form involves emptying the mind to a state where it just exists undisturbed and calm. However, most meditation programs and introductions focus heavily on achieving a close proxy to that empty state – the state of full focus on only one thing. Usually it’s one’s breathing, the feeling of contact with the ground, or perhaps a soundscape of the ambient noise in one’s environment. When focusing 100% on any one thing, it calms the mind.

It is my experience that this same state of meditation can be equated to the state of flow achieved in deep work. Something as simple as spreadsheet analysis can be so all-consuming that it blocks out all other thought. I would contend that the state of flow can be achieved in many professions, and as such, many professionals have a fairly effective proxy for meditation available for use throughout the working day, as long as the day is structured in such a way as to allow for the flow state to occur.

Working arrangements without the opportunity for flow work are different. If there is constant disturbance, no flow can happen, and no meditative state can be achieved. Apart from the effectivity loss, just think of the individual loss of going from hours and hours of potential meditation time per day, to nothing!
