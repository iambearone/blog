Making is acceleration. It propels. It creates progress.

Making is the opposite of consuming.

Making is the difference between something and nothing.

Making is all we have with which to oppose destruction.

Making anew is what protects from stagnation and waste.

Making is what lifts the standard.

Making is the that which, when the universe’s inevitable heat death approaches, lets us say “at least we made something of our time here”.

Make.
