In everything I do, I try to find purpose. I try to find beauty. I try to find art.

There is a way to stand, speak and move that is all of these things. In this form of elevation there is a measure of comfort. There is opportunity. There is something to be found. 

The beautiful way is not the simplest. The purposeful way is not the easiest. But the story worth telling hides in the art.
