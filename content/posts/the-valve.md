The mind races, producing and interpreting for every waking hour.

Thoughts, concepts, ponderings, plans and connections.

It builds up like a reservoir, but unlike a reservoir, all of this has only the space between your ears. A lifetime’s worth of ideas.

Your capacity can stretch, some, and it should. But without limiting the wonderful power of creation, or somehow solving for space, the pressure becomes too great – an outlet is needed. A valve.

Write, draw, speak, play, build – take the internal and make it external and lasting.

Have output, and avoid implosion!
