Sometimes to be data driven means to compare and contrast original and variant, to require statistical rigour, to follow testing methodologies and isolate variables.

That’s great when there’s a baseline.

Sometimes to be data driven something else. It’s a search for the first data point. It’s sampling the tantalising, infinite space of possibility. This requires a different approach. Searching, making, and a different type of testing.

It’s the difference between two simple questions:

>Could this be better?  
*The Scientist*
***
>Could this be?  
*The Artist*

We each have the capacity for both questions and the quests that go with them. But it takes more courage to ask one, depending on what we’re practiced in.
