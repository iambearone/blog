In times of stability, the default assumption for me is that peers are doing fine. I don’t have to ask probing questions, because obviously everything’s all good.

That changes in times of change, turmoil and crisis. There’s a clear challenge, and a shared experience of need. Needing to deal with it, or overcome, or get through. Such a collective experience is a time to develop and demonstrate caring for each other. It’s during trials that strong bonds are forged between people.

In such times, there is an opportunity to reach out. There’s an opportunity to care, and to do work that matters.
