We spend an incredible amount of time working on marketing to sell stuff. To that end, we develop these little stories, designed to evoke emotion, curiosity, connection – to manipulate an audience to come buy stuff. 

But there’s another, far more fascinating reason to tell those stories. 

When we tell a story that’s true, that we’re passionate about, that excites us, we become inspiring. We become elevated. We energise our organisations, teams, friends and family.

When discussing storytelling in the context of branding, the conversation often passes through “maybe it doesn’t matter what we say, as long as it’s consistent” territory. What if it’s not the consistency that makes it work?

When a team tells a story they believe in, that they’re passionate and excited about, they become inspiring. They become elevated. The idea becomes contagious, and people want to connect.

And sometimes, we end up selling some stuff.
