It might feel like you’re doing something new. Something that’s never been done before.

Chances are, 99% of it has – you’re just figuring out the 1% that’s new, adding your own twist.

So for the 99%, you can ask. Phone a friend. Or a stranger.

Somebody has been where you are. Find them. Ask for help.
