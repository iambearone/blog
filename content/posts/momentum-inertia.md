I operate at least one order of magnitude better when I’m on a roll. I suspect this is true to varying degree among most people.

The effect is similar to confirmation bias, or faking-it-until-you-make-it – being on a roll is a story, one that’s hard to diverge from once I’ve entered into the core narrative.

Conversely, just as momentum describes the relationship between an object’s mass and velocity, inertia describes the energy it takes to accelerate or decelerate said object. An entire life turns out to have high inertia. Whether or not it has momentum is largely dependent on consistent effort over a long period of time.

Since life has high inertia, it can feel frustrating to get the ball rolling. But when life does take on momentum, it’s unstoppable. Like a boulder down a mountain, it becomes almost unstoppable (until I die/transfer my energy into the valley).
