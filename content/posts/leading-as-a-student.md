There are 3 ways in which I can position myself, when I want to develop my team.

I can work from the position of a teacher. I have knowledge that I want to share, and it can be effective to enter into a dynamic where I deliver this knowledge to the team from a position of power.

I can work from the position of an equal. This is effective when examining an idea or operational issue, and seeking to generate multiple opinions, and push back and forth. 

I can work from the position of a student. This is possibly my favourite position to lead from. This is most effective when mentoring one to one, and coaching an individual. By meeting someone as a student, they are forced to enter the position of teacher. When the employee is learning specific material, and there’s value in ensuring that the material sticks, it pays off to learn it with the intent of teaching it.

A meeting focused around this dynamic is typically angled towards a series of practical applications in the business. About 70% of the time, I’m able to maintain the position of student. 20% of the time, when discussing specific issues, the dynamic switches to that of peers. And 10% of the time, I fall back to teaching. This is typically if I spot a flaw in the material understanding. 

It’s likely ineffective to flip back to teaching, and I’m working actively to reduce the reflex to lecture, and instead focus on asking questions from the student position. If the employee is unable to answer given appropriate prodding, then they’ll have to (as the teacher) research it for our next session.

Lead as a teacher when knowledge must be transferred immediately for quick deployment. 

Lead as a peer when sparring is important. 

Lead as a student when personal growth and information retention is the goal.
