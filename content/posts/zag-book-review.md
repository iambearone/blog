Zag, Marty Neumeier’s guide to differentiation for high performance brands.

I’m structuring this one as a key takeaways list. It’s a short read, very well suited for revisiting in the future to check in on the quality of the brand being built.

This is my first run-through.

**Page 7:**  
Reduce clutter – clutter comes in multiple forms in the marketplace, but the ones we have control over are feature clutter (too many features in a product), message clutter (too many elements per message). **Takeaway: Single big features, simple clear messages.**

**Page 20:**  
Brand is the customer’s gut feeling about a business. Never to be confused with what we tell the customer. How our message is received, and how they stack and combine to produce a gut feeling is hard to predict, but key to work on. **Takeaway: brand isn’t the latest ad or the company identity. It’s the sum of all touches combined into a fairly simple gut feel.**

**Page 21:**  
If I buy this brand, what will that make me? A question people ask themselves subconsciously when figuring out what products to buy. It’s not a question of solving a problem, it’s a question of tribal association. **Takeaway: at the Trendhim brand level, go WIDE with tribal association. At the product level, go CLEAR with tribal association. The product filter is stronger with us – wearing a product is a clear identity marker. Buying with Trendhim is more diffuse.**

**Page 27:**  
If the ambition is to scale enormously, actually do something unique. If we’re sharing the cake… well… then we’re sharing, not eating it all up. If there’s a competitor that does it better… If we’re not doing something interesting, winning and holding the attention of a marketplace that has a 1s attention span will fail. **Takeaway: Do actual unique things. Provide a unique reason to buy.**

**Page 64:**  
There are some circumstances that favour the leading brand. Of these, the ones that seem to apply to Trendhim are:  
* Advantages are unprovable.  
**Takeaway: The less tangible the advantages of the product are, the more the customer will lean on brand to make their choice of product.**

**Page 65/66**  
This product is the only category that does something/has something for someone in location who desire of customer in time/macro-trend
* E.g. This watch is the ONLY watch that has memento mori and a big skull on it, for young wannabe stoics in pretty much the world, who want to show off their overt stoicism in a time where faith is in decline and other methods are needed for grappling with the meaning of life and death.

Trendhim is the only category that does something/has something for someone in location who desire of customer in time/macro-trend
* E.g. Trendhim is the only DTC men’s accessories store that develops an encompassing range of unique accessories for men globally who want to express their identity, in a time where identity is up for experimentation and diversity is on the agenda.  
**Takeaway: Know what it’s for.**

**Page 81**  
Who’s the enemy?  
**Takeaway: By defining an “out” group, the “in” group is clearer. The out group might just be those who do things in the old way.**

**Page 91**  
Have relatively few visual assets that repeat everywhere. Key visuals must not be so many as to be cluttering.

**Page 96**  
Map it to touchpoints.

**Page 100.**  
Why will people come back?  
**Takeaway: Have a decent answer to why people will come back. Not a loyalty program, or another type of ratchet.**

Apart from these little nuggets, page 138 is where the checklist and summary starts, which is freakishly magical.

Win.
