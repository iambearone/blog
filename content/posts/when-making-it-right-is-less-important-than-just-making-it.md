When developing a concept, it’s tempting to refine, polish, and make sure the direction is just perfect. It’s also tempting to let it “grow” naturally out of the organisation. Both options conveniently prevent you from having to put your own work into the world and standing by it. 

I believe that more often than not, it’s more important to make it, than it is to make it just right.

The consequences of a wrong communication angle are most likely straightforward and low-risk: Total ignorance on the part of your target audience. Then you try again, dig deeper, make it better. 

But you just don’t know until it’s out there. 

Entrepreneurs know this about new business. We forget it when we’re developing new stories, campaigns, and internal concepts. 

Just make it. Make it the way you want it to be. Share that with the organisation, and with the world.
