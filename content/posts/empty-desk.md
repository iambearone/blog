If my incoming task list is growing faster than I can clear it, I have an input control problem. Inversely, if I can clear my tasks faster than they arrive, I can set aside time to develop effective systems and execution strategies. 

The heuristic to look for: Empty Desk. 

Proverbial desk. 

Is the inbox growing? Tighten the input controls. Practice the art of the deflector shield.

Or suffer. The slow and steady spread of mess from surface to surface. The unstoppable tide of new material.

Conversely, is the inbox shrinking, the task lists low, and time to reflect abundant? This is not an excuse to divert myself with more projects. It is a healthy state, keeping me focused on what matters, and leaving plenty of time to work on the big picture. 

Empty Desk. Zen state. Living in flow.
