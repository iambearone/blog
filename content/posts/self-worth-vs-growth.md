>That which is enough does not need to grow. That which grows is never enough.  
*Bear, further down this post.* 

Yet a man must be enough, as well as seeking growth.

How does he balance, teetering on the edge between stagnation and worthlessness?

There is no easy answer, no true answer at all. Perhaps a false dichotomy has been set, insomuch as there is no inherent conflict between finding comfort in oneâ€™s being, and having a desire to grow. It could be a spectrum.

However, at the extremes, the concepts do defy each-other. That which is enough does not need to grow. That which grows is never enough. A man utterly satisfied with what he is, drives not to become something else, something better. A man seeking to be better is not completely fulfilled.

So we dance on a tightrope, changing pace like a frustrated driver in choppy traffic, unsure of the tempo we should take. Life delivers no absolutes, only a balance to strike.

Is it ever time to look back on how far we have come, to find satisfaction?
