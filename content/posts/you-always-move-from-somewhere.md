When seeking to move something, you have to know where it **is**, as well as where it should be, so you can apply a force in the correct direction.

You need to understand the starting point, the force vector, and the end goal.

The same principle guides personal change. Whether you’re trying to move someone else or yourself – you must understand the starting point before you apply a force. Otherwise you will, without a shadow of a doubt, miss the mark.

You always move **from** somewhere. And without knowing where that is, you will never get to where you want to go.
