It’s easy for me to fall for the idea that once I find a perfect system, I’ll be done. I’ll have a recipe for life that just works.

It’d be amazing to have a set of habits and routines that I practice until they’re baked in, and they’ll be all I need to be doing my absolute best for as long as I live.

The problem is the territory is shifting. Laying out a plan for succes in a fixed territory would actually be feasible, but since everything is changing every day, it just doesn’t work.

Work changes, relationships change, pets change, and the world at large changes. The habits and patterns that I’ve honed every month have to be replaced to match changes in the environment. So it’s a continuous process. It never stops, and I can never get off.

I can choose whether to be dynamic or static, though. Whether or not I want to keep trying to build better routines, and replace the ones that no longer match the territory.

Dynamic territory requires dynamic strategy.
