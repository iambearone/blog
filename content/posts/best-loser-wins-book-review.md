Not a trading book, really. 

A mindset book, based on trading examples. 

Core ideas:  
1. Humans seek to avoid pain above all else.
2. How well you can moderate that automatic response will determine a lot about how well you can do in life.

There's not a lot more to it, although the specific mechanics are much more detailed in the book. 

Interesting tidbits:  
* 90% of traders are failing - they lose money. Avoid whatever it is they do. Tom argues that they follow normal human loss avoidance biases.
* Expect failure. Expect that some things will go wrong. You win on average, not on every at-bat opportunity.
