I made a thing.

Expanding Creativity is the fastest way for you to unlock huge portions of your creative potential, to let you make a dent in the world.

The guide is split into short chapters, each finishing with a task to complete. These tasks are designed to be completed periodically, not as one-off performances. Each task is chosen specifically to engage and challenge the bits of your brain you’ll need to unfold yourself and take part in furthering the Collective Creative Canvas of humankind. Running through multiple rounds of each task will get you more leverage on yourself, and shift your paradigms each and every time.

The guide is short on text so that you can get in to the mechanics of your mind as fast as possible, with minimal reading and maximal doing. The first chapter is an introduction to the principles at the foundation of the guide (and the founding principles of thefuture.academy), and then it’s over to you.

The Collective Creative Canvas of humanity is our single most powerful resource on our journey into the future. It is the idea that innovation is driven through the combination of existing concepts. Take part!
