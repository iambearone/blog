Agency. The spice that makes everything anew.

Agency is the cure for “stuck”. It’s the glue that makes organisations work. It’s like adding nitro to an otherwise “OK” engine.

But it’s hard to screen for. High agency individuals don’t wear “Agent” badges. Agency doesn’t often show up in a job interview, and even when it seems to, it might not persist when the rubber hits road.

Agency. The difference between giving up when the recipe didn’t work, and making a new, 10x better recipe.
