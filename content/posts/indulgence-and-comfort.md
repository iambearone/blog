Something I’m pondering lately:

When is it OK to step back, eat some biscuits, and just chill?

I’ve never really found the answer.

Some options include:

* Whenever it is necessary to optimise overall work capacity
* Never. Indulgence and comfort are for people who don’t want to get stuff done.
* Any time you deserve it

None of the options work well.

Optimising overall throughput and work capacity would require a person to understand their capacity as compared to current load, and be able to evaluate their own potential.

Never seeking rest and downtime seems like a recipe for disaster, stress, and failure.

Nobody knows what they deserve.

Tough nut to crack, hope I get it some day.
