I caught myself saying (and meaning): “that shouldn’t even be a factor”, about an emotional influence on a business decision.

It shouldn’t even matter.

…

Because that’s what business has been all about, ever since The Wealth of Nations, and the notion that business is about profit first and only.

I didn’t realise how indoctrinated I was! It took me several hours to realise the depth of the wrongness of that moment. Of course it’s a factor. The simple humanity of my colleagues. How things feel. They are things that matter.

Organisations are human enterprises first – and humans are equipped with an excellent moral compass! To ignore its guidance during the pursuit of “business” is to become a senseless machine.

Well. Off to work on some basic human decency skills, and unschool some classic capitalism…
