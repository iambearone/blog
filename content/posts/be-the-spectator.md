Sometimes life is scary. Overwhelming. Hard to figure out. Uncertain.

Sometimes it can be useful to reframe the situation, when faced with hard choices. Imagine being a spectator, watching the story unfold. 

If you were looking at a character, in your situation, faced with the options you face, what do you think should happen? What would be the most interesting step the character could take? What has been foreshadowed? What is the right thing to do? What would you do? What would someone you admire do? 

And when youâ€™ve played it all out inside, come back to reality. Get back in your space. And do what the character did. Start the story.
