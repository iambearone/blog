*Matthew McConaughey’s 50 years of adventure. The view from the half-way house. A guide to livin.*

McConaughey’s autobiographical work seems an endless stream of adventures. It shows appetite. Hunger. It reminds me to demand more from life.

The meat and the experience of this read is in the stories, but the purpose is to convey eight principles for livin. It’s a handbook that reads like fiction. Vitamins in jelly beans. It creates no FOMO. It ensnared me, and only took a week to finish. It’s worth reading again for the experience AND for the long term value.

1. Outlaw Logic – an introduction to Texas hustle.
2. Find Your Frequency – an invitation to exploration and self discovery.
3. Dirt Roads And Autobahns – putting in the work, doing instead of trying, less impressed and more involved.
4. The Art Of Running Downhill – a recommendation of embracing good times when they come; Don’t trip yourself. Made for the moment. Getting relative.
5. Turn The Page – stories have chapters. Know when to turn the page, and don’t fear it. I have never had any trouble turning the page in the book of my life.
6. The Arrow Doesn’t Seek The Target, The Target Draws The Arrow – try less, and look deeper. Our souls are infinitely magnetic.
7. Be Brave, Take The Hill – easy isn’t the point. Make it work.
8. Live Your Legacy Now – begin with the end in mind.
***
And it’s a reminder that we’re all heading towards the end of the tracks at the same speed.
