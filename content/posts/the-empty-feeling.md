Whether it’s a book series or Netflix binge, there’s a specific feeling associated with a long story coming to and end.

It feels empty.

For me, that feeling comes from having been part of something bigger, and then having it taken away. That’s what it is to join some characters for an adventure, and then have that sense of purpose, striving and progress disappear.

It’s exactly the same feelings that pull me strongly into the content, often to the point of overconsumption.

Sitting with that feeling afterwards is a strong reminder for me to cultivate that same striving, adventure, purpose and progress outside of fiction. To make part of what I do every day. One day, maybe that feeling will leave, and never return, because the story in my life is equally fulfilling as the story in the fairytale.
