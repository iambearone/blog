Imagine someone called you up today, and wanted to make a movie about your life. Take some time to imagine how that conversation would play out. The director is one hundred percent sincere. What are the thoughts that go through your mind? 

I won’t put words into your mouth. I’m sure you can see where this is going. 

For me, my responses are problematic. As children, we all wanted to be heroes. It’s easy to make movies about heroes. 

So what happened? And can we reclaim the heroes?
