Zombie flicks have layers.

Zombies are bad, and they want to eat brains.

Usually, thereâ€™s some extra evil human villains doing messed up stuff. Those people are super nasty.

And finally, some of the good guys break. They lose it. Their inherent human flaws win out.

Zombies are the baddies kids see.

Villains are the real bad guys adolescents see.

The human condition, and the constant flux it creates is what adults see.

Layers.
