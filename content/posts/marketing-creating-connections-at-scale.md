Sales is creating a connection to one person to generate compliance. Salespeople lean on persuasive techniques innumerate, and (the good ones) excel in personal relations, empathy, and authenticity.

When we talk about marketing, what we’re really talking about is how to create meaningful, authentic connections at scale. 

And the answer is rarely about tactics. It’s about being human, tangible, present. It’s about being vulnerable enough to open your business to the world. It’s about being generous enough that people can be bothered to look. It’s about telling stories gripping enough to hold attention. 

Being a good marketer is being a good friend, a creator, a believer, an inspiration, a human – and being able to share those attributes at scale.
